### Hi 👋, I'm Cliff
A fool stack developer coming at'cha with a short stack and some syrup. iHop with my hips but it's not really hip-hop. If you don't know, now you know. (Try to follow if you're slow.)

The best code I've ever written was this here
`let array = ['hip', 'hip'];`
(some folks will get it, others...)
